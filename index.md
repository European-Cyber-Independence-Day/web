title: "Petition for a European Cyber Independence Day"
---

### We propose the establishment of an annual European Cyber Independence Day to test, assert, and improve Europe's independence in information technology.

Currently, many cyber systems deployed in Europe rely on connections to data centers outside of the continent. This dependence poses a significant risk, especially to critical systems used by governments, the military, the energy sector, the banking sector, and various essential services that support the daily lives of European citizens.

It is crucial that not only large organizations but also the general public be aware of this dependence. The disruption of numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and home energy systems could severely impact a country during critical times.

To address this challenge, we propose that the European Commission announce an annual European Cyber Independence Day. On this day, all non-critical communication between the EU/EEA and countries outside of Europe will be suspended. This will serve as an effective measure to test Europe's cyber independence.

The European Cyber Independence Day will:
- Exclude critical communication with partner governments.
- Be announced no more than three months in advance to prevent vendors from disguising their dependence.
- Initially be held on a Sunday and subsequently cycle backward through the weekdays to ensure a gradual implementation.

By proactively testing and strengthening our cyber independence, we can prevent others from exploiting our current vulnerabilities. Let us take this step towards a more resilient and self-reliant Europe.

Support this petition to make European Cyber Independence Day a reality.
